# Project Proposal
Kieran and I agreed agreed to focus on the dataset on debt advice agencies after spending 10 minutes reviewing each of the other data sets. We chose debt advice agencies because we both concluded that it would be the most suitable 
for the two of us to work on.

## Business Case
Bristol's Debt Advice Agency

### Problem statement
There have been countless of visitors and new residents in Bristol without being able to easily find a centralised repository for debt agency information for the city. This makes it difficult for users to find reliable, accurate, and up-to-date agency details. Moreover, the exisiting solutions leave users unaware of the nearby options as they do not provide comprehensive coverage of the debt advice agencies within Bristol's neighbourhoods and zones. 
There is no user-friendly platform to simplify the process of comparing and locating the debt advice centrs based essential parameters such as customers ratings, services offered, and affordability. Thus, our website will also offer the users up-to-date recommendations and other relevant informations, based on the reviews and an assessment of the websites of these agencies making our resources more reliable. Furthermore, many potential users of these agencies are non-native speakers and other diverse kinds of users, e.g., different device/gadget users, color-blind users, etc. Hence, our website also aims to be user-friendly by appealing to many individuals regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, etc, for example by providing different colour themes/modes, language selector options, and a range of font size options, thus making it more inclusive and accessible to majority.

### Business benefits
Quick - It is a quick and straightforward way to get a list of the debt advice agenicies with their useful details and reviews.

Centralised Data - This provides a centralised repository for debt advice agencies and allows potential users to easily navigate them with more reliable and accurate details.

Customer Satisfaction - A user friendly platform to simplify the process of locating and comparing the agencies based off essiential parameters, allowing the users to be aware of their nearby options, thereby leaving them satisfied.

Marketing Awareness: The debt agencies themselves face the challenges in promoting their services and making their services visible to relevant customers due to the lack of a streamlined platform for listing or advertisement.

User Experience - Expanding reach and accessibility by providing language selection options and cross-platform funtionality across different devices. Creating an inclusive and welcoming digital experience for diverse users.

Cost effective - It's free to use and no funding will be necessary to build this website as HTML5, CSS and JAVASCRIPT 
are free coding languages that will be used to assemble this webpage. In addition, potential external 
sources such as google maps and data from OPEN data, which will also arrive at no extra cost.

Recommendations - Our app will provide suggestions of places to visit from customer reviews provided by users of the app.    


### Options Considered
Social Media - Potential customers may want to use social media as alternative as they would be able to get a glimspe of those agencies. However, many sources are not verified, and scams are common. The information on these may be scattered making it hard to compare the options, and some agencies might not even have a social media account.

Word of Mouth (Family or friends) - This option may be quite helpful if the person helping is adequately informed but most often the recommendations from others don't may not include all the available options, and their opinions may not suit the situation. Moreover, discussing some financial struggles with others can feel uncomfortable.

Physical Offices or Walk-in Agencies - This option requires time and effort to visit the location in person and the potential customers may have limited choices as they can only see the locally available agencies. It doesn't give you the option to compare the different agencies easily amd some areas don't have debt advice agencies that are local.

Individual Debt Agency Websites - With these, a potential customer could only view one agency's services and visiting multiple websites takes a lot of effort, thus making it time-consuming and harder to compare. Moreover, one must consider the fact that the individual agencies would promote themselves and not give an impartial overview.


### Expected Risks
Data security- Users will input their personal information when signing in to their accounts on the 
website. If the website's security is not up to scratch, it will be vulnerable to data breaches and will 
in turn violate the GDPR guidelines. 

Maintenance and Cost - Keep the website running smoothly and updated requires signicant resources.Changes are made to Bristol all of the time, including the debt agency points being relocated. Thus, if maintenance is neglected and does not provide up-to-date information, it can become unreliable and outdated.

Lack of Personalised Guidance - The website may provide general information about the debt agencies but lack the ability to offer personalised advice that is tailored to each circumstance. Thus, the users may still require additional help, making the website less effective for some.


## Project Scope

- Our website will be accessible in Mobile and laptop style

- Web app hosting and offline access to essential maps and guides.
